  It was found that a Certificate Authority (CA) issued a fraudulent HTTPS
  certificate. This update renders any HTTPS certificates signed by that
  CA as untrusted, except for a select few. The now untrusted certificates
  that were issued before July 1, 2011 can be manually re-enabled and used
  again at your own risk in Thunderbird; however, affected certificates
  issued after this date cannot be re-enabled or used. (BZ#734316)

  resolves this issue. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.";
