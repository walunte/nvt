  tag_insight = "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
reporter.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
