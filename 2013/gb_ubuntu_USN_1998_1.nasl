  tag_insight = "An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading
broadcast messages from the notify_policy interface of the IPSec
key_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially
sensitive information in kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2237)

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of
the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory
corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report
ID. (CVE-2013-2888)

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem
of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically
proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds
write) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2892)

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface
Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically
proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2896)

Kees Cook discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Human
Interface Device (HID) subsystem when CONFIG_HID_SENSOR_HUB is enabled. A
physically proximate attacker could obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel memory via a specially crafted device.
(CVE-2013-2898)

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem
of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG_HID_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically
proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2899)

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux Kernel's networking stack checks scm
credentials when used with namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this
flaw to gain privileges. (CVE-2013-4300)";
